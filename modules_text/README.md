# Gatsby course modules text

In this course, we will check [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) which is a framework to build websites with `react`. In each module, we will have some text that will help me to write about what I will be learning.

## Module 1: Getting setup

- The first thing you need to have to begin to work is [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) I recommend the `LTS` version
- On the root directory of this repository we have 2 folders in the root directory one call `gatsby`; that is our `frontend` part of the application; and the other is called `sanity`; that is the `backend` of the application. On your terminal go and install all dependencies using:
  `npm install`
- Now we need to set [gatsby-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli) and [@sanity/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/cli) globally on our machine using:
  `sudo npm install gatsby-cli @sanity/cli -g`

  A more in deep look at those packages is going to be available on future modules. Need to use `sudo` on mac and Linux to have administrative permission to install those packages

- To check if you correctly install the packages use the following commands:
  `gatsby --version and sanity --version`

Now you are all set to begin our learning journey.
